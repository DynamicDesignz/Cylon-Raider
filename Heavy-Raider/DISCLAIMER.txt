DISCLAIMER:

There is a huge difference between WPA2-PSK cracking (4-way handshake) and WPS-Cracking.
WPS cracking cannot be done "offline", that is there is no handshake you could quickly capture and then take home and crack it offline.

You usually have to stay in the area between 2 to 10 hours for it to successfully work.

Furthermore the latest version of Reaver (1.5.2) appears to be bugged. I have adapted the commands that Heavy Raider uses to NO NACKS
